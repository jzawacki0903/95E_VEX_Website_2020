      <h2><strong>Our Website:</strong></h2>
      <p>An online challenge available for all VEX Robotics participants is to create a website for public viewing and information about their program. Here are some details about how we made our website!</p>
	  
	  <h3>Our Code</h3>
	  <p>To program this website, the CEC TriBots used a combination of the programing languages HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap 4. HTML5 is the language used for the main structure and content of the website, while CSS3 is used for the style elements on the website. Bootstrap 4 is what most commercial web developers, such as ones for Google or Microsoft, use. Bootstrap 4 allows you to use structural elements from other sources and use them in your website. While we used quite a bit of CSS3 in our website, we did not have to use nearly the amount we would have had to use without Bootstrap 4. Using Bootstrap 4 also saved us quite a lot of time as well, allowing us to program this entire website from scratch. To program this website, we used our own personal computers, as well as the computers in the web design lab at the CEC. The computers at the CEC, however, were equipped with Adobe Dreamweaver and Photoshop, so they were what we did the majority of our programming with.

	  <h3>Our Web Design Process</h3>
	  <p>We didn't jump into Adobe Dreamweaver "guns blazing" to program a brand new website. With experience from the CEC's web design class taught by Mrs. Witcher, we knew that we had to draw out a wireframe for our website, as well as decide on many style and design choices. The first thing we did was draw out a wireframe on paper. We did this in order to decide how we wanted to format the website before we started to code, which prevented any major mistakes. After we had a clear idea of how we wanted the website to look, we decided to choose a color scheme for the website. We decided on a light-grey/white minimalist color scheme for our first iteration of this website. We may decide to change it over the years as we decide to work on this website, as this website will be in use and updated for many seasons of VEX Robotics. After we had the wireframe and design choices, we started to program the website. Initially, we were planning to program the entire website with no Bootstrap 4, but then we decided that it would make our website look more modern, as well as reduce the amount of time needed to program the website. Once we had the home page programmed, we decided to program one other page from scratch and then use those two pages as templates for the others. We decided to do this in order to preserve uniformity and have a similar layout for all pages in the site. After all of our website's pages were coded, we put in the content of the website where we had designated in the code for it to go. After the website was programmed and had content, we put the website through a rigorous testing phase and had the website reviewed by many team members within the CEC TriBots for any content errors, be they grammatical or content errors. When finished with the testing and peer review, we decided to do one final check over of the code before we turned it in to Mr. Brown, our sponsor, for submission.

	  <h3>Looking Towards the Future</h3>
	  <p>The CEC TriBots are planning to take this website and improve on it year by year. By the time that the designers who primarily made this site (Jacob Zawacki and Dawson Pent) graduate from high school and leave the CEC TriBots, years will have passed since this website's initial launch in the winter of 2018-19. To make things easier to read, we decided to make a bulleted list of what we want to have done in the coming years:
		  <ul>
			<li>Add slideshows on the home and team pages</li>
			<li>Incorporate more programming languages, such as PHP, Javascript, and Python</li>
			<li>Improve the website in general based on user feedback</li>
			<li>Save a copy of this website to put on next year's iteration and create a drop-down menu for previous iterations of the website</li>
		  </ul>
