	  <h2><strong>The CEC:</strong></h2>
      <p>The Central Educational Center (CEC) is a school in the Coweta County School System in Newnan, Georgia, that offers classes to students attending the three high schools that are part of the school system, including Newnan High, East Coweta High, and Northgate High. The CEC offers many courses that focus on real-world professions, including, but not limited to, Pre-Engineering, Web Design, Nursing Aid, and many more. The CEC offers many unique oppurtunities, such as the few listed below:</p>
	  
	  <h3>8th Grade Academy</h3>
	  <p>Each school year, the CEC will randomly choose up to 120 upcoming 8th Grade applicants and allow them to attend their 8th Grade year at the CEC. The students enrolled in the 8th Grade Academy get to chose four CEC electives to take, as well as the core classes, at the CEC. The 8th Grade Academy offers many electives, such as Robotics, Music, Broadcasting, and many more. Students at the 8th Grade Academy are encouraged to keep participating in clubs at their base school, and the CEC TriBots reserve one spot on each team for 8th Grade participants.

	  <h3>STEM Career Day and Probe Fair</h3>
	  <p>One day each semester, representatives from various STEM related companies will come to the CEC to provide information on various aspects of the company and how it relates to STEM. At this event, students get a chance to ask questions and receive information about how real companies and employees use STEM in day-to-day operations. The Probe Fair is an after-school event once a semester that invites representatives from various colleges to the CEC to provide information about that college's programs and other information. Many colleges from the state of Georgia and other nearby states, such as Auburn University, are there to provide information, so it is a great opportunity for those almost ready to go to college.

	  <h3>Internships and Opportunities</h3>
	  <p>Students at the CEC are provided many different opportunities for real, on-the-job experience in many different forms throughout their time at the CEC. A popular form of experience comes in the form of internships at the CEC or its partners. Some internships that the CEC offers are an internship at the local German engineering company, an internship with the lead person in charge of all technology at the CEC, and many more. These internships take the place of one elective class on the intern's schedule, so there are no conflicts with extracurriculars or homework and school. The CEC also offers Work Based Learning classes, which are electives that take place in a job setting, where students learn skills that will be useful to the later in their careers.
